  "componentDescription": "NoSsr purposely removes components from the subject of Server Side Rendering (SSR).\r\n\r\nThis component can be useful in a variety of situations:\r\n- Escape hatch for broken dependencies not supporting SSR.\r\n- Improve the time-to-first paint on the client by only rendering above the fold.\r\n- Reduce the rendering time on the server.\r\n- Under too heavy server load, you can turn on service degradation.",
  "propDescriptions": {
    "children": "You can wrap a node.",
    "defer": "If <code>true</code>, the component will not only prevent server-side rendering. It will also defer the rendering of the children into a different screen frame.",
    "fallback": "The fallback content to display."
